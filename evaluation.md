## Technical Requirements:

### 3: Excelling

Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

## Notes
Notes:
* Most of my notes are inline
* Great job styling your app and adding the music feature!
* Remove unused code from production apps
* Work on making your code more DRY using functions!
* Remove extra files not being used -- this is what Git is for! Tracking changes so that you can go back to a previous version of the code. No need for new files!
